               <li>
                  <p>As with any side project I have done in the past, this is purely for fun. However, this time I need to create this to solidify my understanding of bootstrap. In this site you will find a demonstration of every CSS feature Bootstrap has to offer, along with more stuff that makes sense to add to this.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>My idea here is to theme this using the same logic as CSS Zen Garden. Here are some goals that I have set, and some more that ChatGPT have generated me to follow. </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <p>Use of Semantic HTML ðŸ˜€</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Proper use of flex, padding, and margin ðŸ™‚</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Mobile responsive for all breakpoints ðŸ˜†</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Bootstrap first styling ðŸ˜…</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>This is everything that I could think of off the top of my head. Enter <strong>ChatGPT ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)</strong></p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Accessibility (easy): Ensuring that your website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is essential for a good user experience. Use ARIA attributes, appropriate alternative text for images, and focus management for keyboard navigation.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Use of utility classes (easy): Bootstrap comes with a range of utility classes that can help you style your project without writing custom CSS. Familiarize yourself with these classes to save time and maintain a consistent look across your project.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Customizing Bootstrap variables (medium): You can customize Bootstrap's default theme by modifying its SCSS variables. This allows you to create a unique look for your project while still using the powerful Bootstrap framework. Learn how to customize variables and compile the modified SCSS into CSS.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Component customization (medium): Sometimes, Bootstrap's default components might not fit your design requirements perfectly. Learn how to customize and extend Bootstrap components to create the desired look and functionality for your project.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Use of CSS Grid (medium): Although Bootstrap provides a flexible grid system, learning CSS Grid can help you create more complex layouts that might be difficult to achieve with Bootstrap alone. You can combine CSS Grid with Bootstrap to create a powerful and versatile layout system.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Integrating JavaScript plugins (hard): Bootstrap comes with various built-in JavaScript plugins, such as modals, tooltips, and carousels. Familiarize yourself with their usage and customization to add interactivity and enhance the user experience of your project.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Performance optimization (hard): Improve your website's performance by optimizing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript, and implementing lazy-loading for images and other resources. A faster-loading website provides a better user experience and can also improve your search engine ranking.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Implementing a CSS preprocessor (hard): If you find yourself writing a lot of custom CSS, consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or LESS. This allows you to use variables, mixins, and functions to write more maintainable and efficient CSS.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Cross-browser compatibility (hard): Ensure that your website works consistently across all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. This may involve testing and tweaking your CSS and JavaScript to account for differences in browser implementations and rendering engines.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Progressive enhancement (hard): Build your website with a "mobile-first" approach and then progressively enhance it with more advanced features and styling for larger screens. This ensures that your website is usable and accessible on a wide range of devices, even those with limited capabilities.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>5/1/2023 --</i> Okay, as you can tell ChatGPT went overboard as always. However, <strong>nothing</strong> is impossible!</p>
