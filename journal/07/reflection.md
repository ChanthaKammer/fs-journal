# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Doing the last checkpoint this week has been a lot of fun. The back-end took an entire day which was fine, I haven't done a checkpoint on a backend so I was not surprised. The front end is going smoother than I expected it to. Having gained more knowledge on vue from doing the network checkpoint I am able to debug vue much faster than last week. After this checkpoint I will be solid with both vue and mongodb, which is very exciting. I am beginning to recognize the same patterns on websites I use daily that we use in Vue MVC. Hopefully after this I am less afraid of handling API's since I wrote my own. Some of the data that I have looked at from other APIs is a bit daunting, such is programming.
