# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This weak was difficult to say the least. It's a good time though, we all are struggling with the same concepts. The open communication amongst ourselves has let me know that I am not the only one struggling here. A surprise for me this week would be the amount of information that was taught. I think these complex subjects should be taught like this, because as I implement more concepts from the lecture projects into my labs, I remember bits and pieces that I thought I forgot. MVC is a beast, I'm glad we are learning the cinder blocks of web development before we have our own concrete machine. A victory for me was sitting here tonight doing the journal questions, I was beat today for sure. As we keep building upon MVC I am sure that I will understand it, the journal questions helped me understand it and the concepts around it much better.
