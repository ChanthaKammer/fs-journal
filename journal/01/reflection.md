# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
> This week I really enjoyed the labs, there weren't too many hiccups but help from the tutors got me over some things that I was stuck on. One things I had to do for myself was before getting help, finishing the other parts of the lab / project that I am able to do. This is useful because the same problem that I am experiencing I will probably run into in another part of my project. So by going through and doing the other parts, I am isolating the problem that I need to do as the last step of finishing a project.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
One suprise to me was learning how double quotes and single quotes work in a template. Sam showed me a problem where I was using double quotes within double quotes which spits out a syntax error.
- What are you struggling with?
Currently I am struggling with some javascript. It will be covered next week but today I intend to go over functions and scope.
- What would you count as a victory?
I consider finishing moody kittens a victory, Sam was very helpful showing me some areas that were messed up. She also brought the debugger to my attention which is another thing I'm going to have to explore.
