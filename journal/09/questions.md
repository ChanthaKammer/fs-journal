# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> Inheritence is where there is a parent class that defines general properties of an object, and a subclass uses the parent properties along with its' own properties. 

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> Singleton is having only one instance of a class. An example of this would be AppState since there is only one instance of it used globally to access the variables within it.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer pattern is where multiple objects depends on the state of a single object. For example, when a game is marked as finished, a scoreboard component would update with the final score of the match, and a MVP component could update to display the final score of the best player.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> The strategy design pattern is where functions are written with intent to be altered to suit a specific purpose. An example would be a generic capitilization class that can be used within another class with different parameters.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The factory design pattern means that a parent class holds the main properties to declare an instance of an object, but child classes are the only classes that objects are declared under. An example of this could be an animal class that holds weight, height, and age, while a cat class includes the properties of the animal class along with whiskers, fur color, and claw count.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test driven development is where specific test cases are set up to test logic of the specific task. Postman tests are a good example since tests allow us to test backend functionality in large batches of tests. TDD is especially useful when used in steps. In MVC we would log out the controller, then log from the service, and then log the results before hooking into our AppState. This approach prevents us from messing up our AppState while we are writing out code.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> DoD stands for definition of done. In our checkpoints we have different checks to make sure our program functions as it should. In group capstones this would be the MVP.

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> A new Uber user signing up and scheduling their first ride. This would include sign up, setting up a form of payment, identity verification, and learning to use the UI. Another example would be a User scheduling their ride instead of taking it on demand, and choosing Uber Black instead of Uber Standard. Both of these user stories have points where they are interacting with the same components of the application, and both end up with them getting a ride. 

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> This is done in sprint planning.

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> In sprint planning and daily standup tasks are assigned to you. The sprint review does not include getting tasks assigned to you.
