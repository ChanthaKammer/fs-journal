# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I didn't think I would fully grasp MVC this week but everything clicked for me once I started working on houses. Trivia night was a nice exploration of how an API functions, but houses really solidified my knowledge thus far on MVC. Pokemon was definitely a fun one, that was sort of like hitting two API's at once but not really, the NASA APOD project in lab today was a good example of hitting multiple API's. As far as struggling this week just a little bit on async, and API methods, but those are small struggles compared to the MVC last week. I would say a victory this week would be the team programming with AJ, Abdul, and I. I really enjoyed working with them. A three person team is really overpowered for the team lab which was nice. We all used live share too which was pretty interesting.
