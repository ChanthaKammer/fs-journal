# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

My current strength this week was being able to understand and write javascript much faster than I can style a webpage, which can also be viewed as a weakness. I really enjoyed partnering up with Steve again, we work very well together as a team. My biggest victory this week was asking for help with a problem that I thought was easy to handle. That problem was a 2 second fix and explaining the problem made the solution clear to me. Such is life I suppose. I am very appreciative that I felt comfortable going through with that.
